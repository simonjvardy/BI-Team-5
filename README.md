***Cafe Java** is a local coffee shop which is unable to operate smoothly due to the Global Pandemic (Covid). The cofee shop was only able to accept walk in customers, which under current safety regulations are seen as not safe and more importantly it has seen an increase in revenu loses. As a team, we have build a website to enable **Cafe Java** customers to make their orders online in advance of their visit to the shop with the aim to save the business from collapsing.*

## UX (User Experience) ##

## Project Goals ##

The **goal** of this project is to build a website which allows a local coffee shop to better manage their business, minimise revenue loses and comply with social distancing requirements due to the Global Covid-19 pandemic.

The features on the website will:

- Give customers more ways to interact with the shop (online bookings, social media, phone, email)
- Enable the business to better manager the flow of customers through their premises and ensure safe conditions for all.

We achieve this by:

- Providing an option to the customers to make their **to-go** orders online.
- Prividing an option to the customers to **book a table** to prevent instances where the cafe it at full capacity and social distancing is not maintained.

## User Goals ##

- **Book** a table in the coffee shop for a specific time.
- **Order** a coffee **online** for collection.
- **Link** to the coffee shop social media sites.

## User Stories ##

- As a **user**, I want to see a **menu** for the coffee shop.
- As a **user**, I want to know **where** the coffee shop is **located on a map**.
- As a **user**, I want to be able to **book a table online** for a **chosen time** slot to have coffee in the coffee shop.
- As a **user**, I want to **order my coffee online** to takeaway.
- As a **user**, I can **enter** my contact **details** to **secure my booking**.
  
****Please note, all of the sections in both booking forms are mandatory*

- As a **user**, I can place an order for my coffee in advance of my visit.
- As a **user**, I can get a **notification** my order is placed and a confirmation message reciting the order is displayed on a new webpage.
- As a **user**, I can **contact** the shop for any order problems using their **social media** channels, **call** them or **email**.

## Site Owner Goals ##

- As a **site owner**, I want to create an interactive website allowing the user to look at the menu, book a table at the coffee shop or order a coffee to go.
- As a **site owner**, I want the user to be able to see a location of the coffee shop on the google maps.
- As a **site owner**, I want my users to be able to connect with the owner via social media channels.

## User Requirements and Expectations ##

- **Header**, **Main body** devided into section and **Footer**.
- In the **Header** we should see a **Logo** and a **navigation bar** on the left side with option to go to:
  - **Home section** (top of the site)
  - **Menu section**
  - **Booking section**
  - **Contact us** section
- On the right side of the **Header** you should see additional **Book here!** button that should take you straight to the booking section.

- In the **Main body** we should see:
  - **Welcome** section with a welcome message.
  - **Menu** displaying a carousel with drinks order choices.
  - **Booking forms** (both drink in/take away).
  - **Contact us** section displaying google maps with the coffee shop location.

## Design Choices ##

### Fonts ###

We have chosen [Josefin](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Josefin+Sans?query=jose#standard-styles) for all of the headers and [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway?query=ralew#standard-styles) the rest of the text.  We have used a [Caveat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Caveat?query=caveat) font for the logo and headlines throughout the site.

### Colours ###

We have chosen the colour that say *"coffee now please!"*, applealing to the eye and also compliments the design of the project.
![Color palette](wireframes/Palette-6.png)

- *Grullo* (AF9483) - Light soft brown
- *Umber* (615550) - Dark bronw
- *Albaster* (F0EDE5) - Off white

These coulours will compliment each other well when used accross the site creating pleasant ambience.

### Wireframes ###

We designed our site moc-ups using [balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). We were focusing on defining basic layout structure of the site and identifying how displays would change on different screen sizes such as [mobile](/wireframes/mobile.jpg), [tablet](/wireframes/tablet.jpg) and [desktop](/wireframes/desktop.jpg).
