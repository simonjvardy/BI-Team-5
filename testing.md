#### Unsolved Bugs ####

[Issue #20](https://github.com/AlexNexton/BI-Team-5/issues/20)
- When ordering a drink to go in the Book & Order section you can only order one drink. This makes it difficult to order multiple drinks to go.

[Issue #38](https://github.com/AlexNexton/BI-Team-5/issues/38) 
- In Safari only, when clicking the social media link icons the hover colour change doesn't work. The icon colour changes on click and remains until another icon is clicked.
